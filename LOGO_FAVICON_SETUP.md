## How to Upload Logo & Favicon

### Step 1: Access Django Admin

**Local Development:**
```
http://localhost:8000/admin/
```

**Production:**
```
https://api.alphalpgas.co.za/admin/
```

Login with your superuser credentials.

### Step 2: Go to Company Settings

1. In the admin panel, find **"Core"** section
2. Click on **"Company Settings"**
3. Click on the existing settings entry (there should be only one)

### Step 3: Upload Your Files

Scroll down to the **"Branding"** section:

#### Upload Logo:
- Click **"Choose File"** next to **Logo**
- Select your logo file
- **Recommended:**
  - Format: PNG with transparent background
  - Size: 200x200px (square) or 300x100px (horizontal)
  - File size: Under 500KB
  - Should look good on dark background (for navbar)

#### Upload Favicon:
- Click **"Choose File"** next to **Favicon**
- Select your favicon file
- **Recommended:**
  - Format: PNG or ICO
  - Size: 32x32px or 64x64px
  - File size: Under 100KB
  - Simple, recognizable design

### Step 4: Save

Click **"Save"** button at the bottom of the page.

### Step 5: Verify

**Backend (Accounting System):**
- Refresh the accounting dashboard
- Logo should appear in the navigation bar (top left)
- Favicon should appear in browser tab

**Frontend (Customer Website):**
- Visit your website
- Favicon should load automatically
- Logo available via API for future use

## Technical Details

### How It Works:

1. **Upload via Admin** → Files saved to `/media/branding/`
2. **Backend** → Context processor makes settings available to all templates
3. **Frontend** → `FaviconLoader` component fetches from API and updates favicon dynamically
4. **API** → Settings available at `/api/accounting/settings/`

### API Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "company_name": "Alpha LPGas",
  "logo": "/media/branding/logo.png",
  "logo_url": "https://api.alphalpgas.co.za/media/branding/logo.png",
  "favicon": "/media/branding/favicon.png",
  "favicon_url": "https://api.alphalpgas.co.za/media/branding/favicon.png",
  "phone": "074 454 5665",
  "email": "info@alphalpgas.co.za",
  ...
}
```

### Using Logo in Frontend:
```typescript
import { useCompanySettings } from '@/hooks/useCompanySettings'

function MyComponent() {
  const { settings, loading } = useCompanySettings()
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  
  return (
    <img 
      src={settings?.logo_url || '/default-logo.png'} 
      alt={settings?.company_name}
    />
  )
}
```

4. Download and upload via admin

**Option 2: Convert Logo**

### Logo Design Tips:

**Good Logo Characteristics:**
- ✅ Transparent background (PNG format)
- ✅ Works on dark backgrounds
- ✅ Clear and readable
- ✅ Not too tall (40-50px height ideal for navbar)
- ✅ Professional appearance

**Avoid:**
- ❌ White/light background (clashes with dark navbar)
- ❌ Too much detail (hard to see when small)
- ❌ Very tall logos (takes too much space)
- ❌ Low resolution (looks pixelated)

## Troubleshooting

### Logo not showing in navbar:
1. Check file uploaded successfully in admin
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
3. Verify file format is supported (PNG, JPG)
4. Check image isn't corrupted

### Favicon not updating:
1. **Clear browser cache completely:**
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cached images
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cache
2. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R
3. **Try incognito/private mode**
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** (browsers cache favicons aggressively)
5. **Restart browser completely**

### File upload error:
1. Check file size (should be under 5MB)
2. Verify file is an image format
3. Try different image format (PNG instead of JPG)
4. Compress image if too large

### Logo too big/small in navbar:
1. Edit image to resize before uploading
2. Recommended: 40-50px height
3. Use image editor or online tool

```env

### After Deployment:
