# üöÄ Railway Deployment Guide for Alpha LPGas

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- Your code pushed to GitHub

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Repository**

Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin dev
```

---

### **Step 2: Create Railway Project**

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"Start a New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub
5. Select repository: `chiwarira/alpha-lpgas-new`
6. Railway will detect both Django and Next.js

### **Step 3: Set Up Backend (Django)**

Railway will create a service for the backend automatically.

#### **Add PostgreSQL Database:**
1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"** ‚Üí **"PostgreSQL"**
3. Railway will create and link the database automatically

#### **Configure Environment Variables:**

Click on your Django service ‚Üí **"Variables"** tab ‚Üí Add these:

```env
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-generate-a-new-one
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=.railway.app,.up.railway.app
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Database (Railway provides this automatically as DATABASE_URL)
# No need to add manually

# CORS Settings
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-url.up.railway.app
CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=True

# Static Files
STATIC_URL=/static/
MEDIA_URL=/media/

# Wagtail
WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME=Alpha LPGas

# Email (Optional - for production)
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True

YOCO_PUBLIC_KEY=your-yoco-public-key
```

#### **Generate SECRET_KEY:**
Run this in Python:
```python
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
print(get_random_secret_key())
```

---

### **Step 4: Set Up Frontend (Next.js)**

Railway will create a separate service for the frontend.

#### **Configure Environment Variables:**

Click on your Next.js service ‚Üí **"Variables"** tab ‚Üí Add these:

```env
# Backend API URL (will be your Django Railway URL)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app

# Yoco Public Key
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOCO_PUBLIC_KEY=your-yoco-public-key
```

---

### **Step 5: Deploy**

1. Railway will automatically deploy both services
2. Wait for builds to complete (5-10 minutes)
3. Check deployment logs for any errors

---

### **Step 6: Initial Setup**

Once deployed, you need to create a superuser:

1. Go to your Django service in Railway
2. Click on **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Deploy Logs"**
3. Or use Railway CLI:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run Django commands
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

### **Step 7: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)**

2. Go to **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Domains"**
3. Click **"Generate Domain"** or **"Custom Domain"**
4. Add your domain and update DNS records

Update environment variables:
```env
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,.railway.app
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

---

## üîß Post-Deployment Tasks

### **1. Create Superuser**
```bash
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### **2. Access Admin Panel**
- Backend Admin: `https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app/admin/`
- Wagtail CMS: `https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app/cms/`

### **3. Configure Wagtail Site**
